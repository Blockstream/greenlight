// The scheduler service is the endpoint which allows users to
// register a new node with greenlight, recover access to an existing
// node if the owner lost its credentials, schedule the node to be run
// on greenlight's infrastructure, and retrieve metadata about the
// node.
//
// Node
// ====
//
// A node is the basic object representing an account on
// greenlight. Each node corresponds to a c-lightning instance bound
// to a specific network that can be scheduled on greenlight, and must
// have a unique `node_id`.
//
// Nodes are scheduled on-demand onto the infrastructure, but the time
// to schedule a node is almost instantaneous.
//
// Authentication
// ==============
//
// Users are authenticated using mTLS authentication. Applications are
// provisioned with an anonymous keypair that is not bound to a node,
// allowing access only to the unauthenticated endpoints
// `Scheduler.GetChallenge`, `Scheduler.Register` and
// `Scheduler.Recover`. This allows them to register or recover a
// node, but doesn't give access to the node itself. Upon registering
// or recovering an account the user receives a keypair that is bound
// to the specific node. Once the user receives their personal mTLS
// keypair they may use it to connect to greenlight, and thus get
// access to the node-specific functionality. Please refer to the
// documentation of your grpc library to learn how to configure grpc
// to use the node-specific mTLS keypair.
//
service Scheduler {
	// A user may register a new node with greenlight by providing
	// some basic metadata and proving that they have access to
	// the corresponding private key (see challenge-response
	// mechanism below). This means that in order to register a
	// new node the user must have access to the corresponding
	// private keys to prove ownership, and prevent users from
	// just registering arbitrary node_ids without actually
	// knowing the corresponding secrets.
	//
	// Upon successful registration an mTLS certificate and
	// private key are returned. These can be used to authenticate
	// future connections to the scheduler or the node.
	//
	// Each node may be registered once, any later attempt will
	// result in an error being returned. If the user lost its
	// credentials it can make use of the Recover RPC method to
	// recover the credentials. Notice that this also means that
	// the same node_id cannot be reused for different networks.
	rpc Register(RegistrationRequest) returns (RegistrationResponse) {}

	// Should a user have lost its credentials (mTLS keypair) for
	// any reason, they may regain access to their node using the
	// Recover RPC method. Similar to the initial registration the
	// caller needs to authenticate the call by proving access to
	// the node's secret. This also uses the challenge-response
	// mechanism.
	//
	// Upon success a newly generated mTLS certificate and private
	// key are returned, allowing the user to authenticate going
	// forward. Existing keypairs are not revoked, in order to
	// avoid locking out other authenticated applications.
	rpc Recover(RecoveryRequest) returns (RecoveryResponse) {}

	// Challenges are one-time values issued by the server, used
	// to authenticate a user/device against the server. A user or
	// device can authenticate to the server by signing the
	// challenge and returning the signed message as part of the
	// request that is to be authenticated.
	//
	// Challenges may not be reused, and are bound to the scope
	// they have been issued for. Attempting to reuse a challenge
	// or use a challenge with a different scope will result in an
	// error being returned.
	rpc GetChallenge(ChallengeRequest) returns (ChallengeResponse) {}

	// Scheduling takes a previously registered node, locates a
	// free slot in greenlight's infrastructure and allocates it
	// to run the node. The node then goes through the startup
	// sequence, synchronizing with the blockchain, and finally
	// binding its grpc interface (see Node service below) to a
	// public IP address and port. Access is authenticated via the
	// mTLS keypair the user received from registering or
	// recovering the node.
	//
	// Upon success a NodeInfoResponse containing the grpc
	// connection details and some metadata is returned. The
	// application must use the grpc details and its node-specific
	// mTLS keypair to interact with the node directly.
	rpc Schedule(ScheduleRequest) returns (NodeInfoResponse) {}

	// Much like `Schedule` this call is used to retrieve the
	// metadata and grpc details of a node. Unlike the other call
	// however it is passive, and will not result in the node
	// being scheduled if it isn't already running. This can be
	// used to check if a node is already scheduled, or to wait
	// for it to be scheduled (e.g., if the caller is an `hsmd`
	// that signs off on changes, but doesn't want to keep the
	// node itself scheduled).
	rpc GetNodeInfo(NodeInfoRequest) returns (NodeInfoResponse) {}

	// The signer may want to trigger an upgrade of the node
	// before waiting for the node to be scheduled. This ensures
	// that the signer version is in sync with the node
	// version. The scheduler may decide to defer upgrading if the
	// protocols are compatible. Please do not use this directly,
	// rather use the Signer in the client library to trigger this
	// automatically when required. Posting an incomplete or
	// non-functional UpgradeRequest may result in unschedulable
	// nodes.
