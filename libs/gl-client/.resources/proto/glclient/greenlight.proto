// with your node. The URI used to connect to the node depends on
// where the node is being scheduled and is returned by the
// `Scheduler.Schedule()` RPC call.
//
// Notice that in order to connect to the node the caller must use the
// node-specific mTLS keypair returned by `Scheduler.Register()` or
// `Scheduler.Recover()`. In particular the anonymous mTLS keypair is
// rejected by the node.
//
// Deprecated methods are being replaced by the standardized and
// automatically managed cln-grpc protocol you can find in
// `node.proto`. This interface consists mostly of
// Greenlight-specific, and backported functionality.
