    ====

    A node is the basic object representing an account on

    Authentication
    ==============

    Users are authenticated using mTLS authentication. Applications are
    provisioned with an anonymous keypair that is not bound to a node,
    allowing access only to the unauthenticated endpoints
    `Scheduler.GetChallenge`, `Scheduler.Register` and
    `Scheduler.Recover`. This allows them to register or recover a
    node, but doesn't give access to the node itself. Upon registering
    or recovering an account the user receives a keypair that is bound
    to the specific node. Once the user receives their personal mTLS
    keypair they may use it to connect to greenlight, and thus get
    access to the node-specific functionality. Please refer to the
    documentation of your grpc library to learn how to configure grpc
    to use the node-specific mTLS keypair.
