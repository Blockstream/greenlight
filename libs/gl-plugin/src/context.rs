//! Manage a signature request context.
//!
//! The signature request context is composed of any currently pending grpc request (serialized as byte string), along with a public key (corresponding to the caller's mTLS certificate), an attestation (signature) by the signer about the authenticity of this public key, as well as a signature from the caller's public key over the serialized payload.
//!
//! It is used by the signer to verify that:
//!
//! a) The caller is authenticated and authorized to initiate the
//!    action with the grpc call.
//! b) Verify that the changes that the signer is being asked to
//!    sign off actually match the authentic commands by a valid
//!    caller.
