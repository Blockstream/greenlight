# Introduction

## Summary
[Greenlight](https://blockstream.com/lightning/greenlight) is a [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com) service offering
hosted, non-custodial, Lightning Network nodes to developers and 
end-users. We take care of the infrastructure, while you are in 
control of the keys.

Nodes can be registered and started in seconds, perfect for new users
that are just starting their Bitcoin and Lightning Network journey,
developers wanting to provide their users with access to the Lightning
Network, or hobbyists wanting to hack tools for their own use. It is
not our goal to lock users into our infrastructure: once you've 
gained experience running a node, you can off-board into your own 
infrastructure, and we'll teach you how to do that too.
