Both of these are read-only operations, that do not require a signer to sign off. What happens if we issue a command that requires a signer to sign off? Let's try to connect to create an invoice. Invoices are signed using the node key, and the signer is the only component with access to your key.</p> RustPython <pre><code>let amount = AmountOrAny {\n    value: Some(amount_or_any::Value::Amount(Amount { msat: 10000 })),\n};\n\nnode.invoice(cln::InvoiceRequest {\n    amount_msat: Some(amount),\n    description: \"description\".to_string(),\n    label: \"label\".to_string(),\n    ..Default::default()\n})\n.await\n.unwrap();\n</code></pre> <pre><code>node.invoice(\n    amount_msat=clnpb.AmountOrAny(amount=clnpb.Amount(msat=10000)),\n    description=\"description\",\n    label=\"label\",\n)\n</code></pre> <p>You'll notice that these calls hang indefinitely. This is because the signer is not running and not attached to the node, and without its signature we can't create the invoice. This isn't just the case for the <code>invoice</code> call either, all calls that somehow use the Node ID, or move funds, will require the signer's sign-off. You can think of a node without a signer being connected as a read-only node, and as soon as you attach the signer, the node becomes fully functional. So how do we attach the signer? Simple: load the secret from where you stored it in the last chapter, instantiate the signer with it and then start it.</p> RustPython <pre><code>let seed = read_file(\"seed\");\nlet signer = Signer::new(seed, network, device_creds.clone()).unwrap();\n\nlet (_tx, rx) = tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(1);\ntokio::spawn(async move {\n    signer.run_forever(rx).await.unwrap();\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Notice that <code>signer.run_forever()</code> returns a <code>Future</code> which you can spawn a new task with. That is also the reason why a separate shutdown signal is provided.</p> <pre><code>seed = read_file(\"seed\")\nsigner = Signer(seed, network, device_creds)\n\nsigner.run_in_thread()\n</code></pre> <p>If you kept the stuck commands above running, you should notice that they now return a result. As mentioned before many RPC calls will need the signer to be attached to the node, so it's best to just start it early, and keep it running in the background whenever possible. The signer will not schedule the node by itself, instead waiting on the scheduler, so it doesn't consume much resources, but still be available when it is needed.</p>"},{"location":"reference/","title":"References","text":"<p>Greenlight is based on the interplay a multitude of both novel and old concepts and components, whose necessity or inner workings may not be immediately apparent.</p> <p>In the following pages we aim to provide the necessary background and technical details to show how certain aspects are achieved in Greenlight.

To facilitate this transition, we have implemented an export functionality that allows users to seamlessly move their node off our infrastructure.

With this export, users can deploy their node independently, ensuring they retain control and ownership of their Lightning Network experience.</p> <p>Nodes can be exported entirely, including all of their funds and channel remaining intact.

This lack of inbound connectivity is crucial for a non-custodial hosted Lightning node, since the user cannot access the node via their app, without configuring the network router or firewall.</p> <p>This is why we built the node domain server, a reverse proxy that smooths the user experience and hides the connection details behind a simple, publicly reachable URL.</p>"},{"location":"reference/node-domain/#enter-the-node-domain","title":"Enter the Node Domain","text":"<p>The node domain is a unique URL designed to provide seamless access to a user's Lightning node, regardless of its location \u2014 whether hosted on Greenlight's infrastructure or self-hosted by the user.

We have written our very first test. However, our test is still fairly useless, let's replace it with something actually meaningful.</p> <p>As a first step, we create a small network of Core Lightning nodes to  which we will connect our Greenlight node later on. Fortunately, <code>pyln-testing</code> provides us with some fixtures that handle common tasks for us. We can use this fixture to start and control  non-Greenlight nodes.</p> <p>my-first-test.py<pre><code>from gltesting.fixtures import *\n\ndef test_invoice_payment(node_factory, clients, bitcoind):\n    # Create 2-node-network (l1)----(l2)\n    l1, l2 = node_factory.line_graph(2)\n    l2.fundwallet(sats=2*10**6)\n</code></pre> Here we used the <code>node_factory</code> fixture to create a <code>line-graph</code>  network consisting of two Core Lightning nodes <code>l1</code> and <code>l2</code> that  already have a channel established between them. The nodes have an  integrated rpc client that we can use to fund the <code>l2</code> node with  <code>2000000sat</code>.</p> <p>Tip: Use your IDEs autocompletion</p> <p>If you want to use the autocompletion features of your IDE you need to select the python interpreter form the environment set by  poetry in <code>libs/gl-testing</code>. You can then import the classes from  the fixtures and annotate the fixtures with its types. e.g.  <pre><code>from gltesting.fixtures import *\nfrom gltesting.fixtures import Clients\nfrom pyln.testing.fixtures import NodeFactory, LightningNode\n...\ndef test_xyz(node_factory: NodeFactory, clients: Clients):\n    nodes: list[LightningNode] = node_factory.line_graph(2)\n    l1, l2 = nodes[0], nodes[1]\n...\n</code></pre></p> <p>Now we can finally start to deal with Greenlight. We use the <code>clients</code>  fixture to create a new client, along with its own directory, signer  secret, and certificates. After that we can call the  <code>Client.register()</code> method to register the client with Greenlight and and <code>Client.node()</code> to schedule and return the Greenlight node that  belongs to the registered client. The <code>configure=True</code> argument tells the client to store the client certificates.</p> my-first-test.py<pre><code>from gltesting.fixtures import *\n\ndef test_invoice_payment(node_factory, clients, bitcoind):\n    # Create 2-node-network (l1)----(l2)\n    l1, l2 = node_factory.line_graph(2)\n    l2.fundwallet(sats=2*10**6)\n\n    # Register a new Greenlight client.\n    c = clients.new()\n    c.register(configure=True)\n    gl1 = c.node()\n</code></pre> <p>Congratulations, we have our first Greenlight node up and running on the testing framework! </p> <p>Let's connect our Greenlight node to the  network now. To do so we need to establish a channel between our Greenlight node and the network. We choose the <code>l2</code> node as the entry point for our Greenlight node. Funding the channel between <code>l2</code> and  <code>gl</code> requires us to connect to <code>l2</code> and to fund a channel. The  connection handshake as well as the channel funding and eventually the creation of an invoice require the presence of a signer for the node. Greenlight signers run on the client side to keep the custody on the users side. We first need to start the client signer so that the node can request signatures from the signer.</p> my-first-test.py<pre><code>from gltesting.fixtures import *\n\ndef test_invoice_payment(node_factory, clients, bitcoind):\n    # Create 2-node-network (l1)----(l2)\n    l1, l2 = node_factory.line_graph(2)\n    l2.fundwallet(sats=2*10**6)\n\n    # Register a new Greenlight client.\n    c = clients.new()\n    c.register(configure=True)\n    gl1 = c.node()\n\n    # Start signer and connect to (l2)\n    s = c.signer().run_in_thread()\n    gl1.connect_peer(l2.info['id'], f'127.0.0.1:{l2.daemon.port}')\n</code></pre> <p>We are almost there! Now we fund a channel between <code>l2</code> and <code>gl</code>. We  import a helper function  <code>from pyln.testing.utils import wait_for</code> that helps us to wait for the channel to be established.This will poll <code>gl1</code> for its channel states and return as soon as the state indicates that the channel is  confirmed and fully functional.</p> my-first-test.py<pre><code>from gltesting.fixtures import *\nfrom pyln.testing.utils import wait_for\n\ndef test_invoice_payment(node_factory, clients, bitcoind):\n    # Create 2-node-network (l1)----(l2)\n    l1, l2 = node_factory.line_graph(2)\n    l2.fundwallet(sats=2*10**6)\n\n    # Register a new Greenlight client.\n    c = clients.new()\n    c.register(configure=True)\n    gl1 = c.node()\n\n    # Start signer and connect to (l2)\n    s = c.signer().run_in_thread()\n    gl1.connect_peer(l2.info['id'], f'127.0.0.1:{l2.daemon.port}')\n\n    # Fund a channel (l2)----(gl).\n    # This results in the following network\n    # (l1)----(l2)----(gl)\n    l2.rpc.fundchannel(c.node_id.hex(), 'all')\n    # Generate a block to synchronize and proceed\n    # with the channel funding.\n    bitcoind.generate_block(1, wait_for_mempool=1)\n    # Wait for the channel to confirm.\n    wait_for(lambda:\n        gl1.list_peers().peers[0].channels[0].state == 'CHANNELD_NORMAL'\n    )\n</code></pre> <p>Before we create and pay the invoice we also need to wait for the  gossip to reach every node. Otherwise the invoice will be lacking route hints as it assumes its only channel to be a dead end. Alternatively we could also create the invoice directly and wait for  <code>l1</code> to have a full view of our small network but lets go with the  first option this time. We again use the <code>wait_for</code> function. The successor function checks that we see 4 channel entries in our view of the network as both channels are bidirectional.</p> my-first-test.py<pre><code>from gltesting.fixtures import *\nfrom pyln.testing.utils import wait_for\n\ndef test_invoice_payment(node_factory, clients, bitcoind):\n    # Create 2-node-network (l1)----(l2)\n    l1, l2 = node_factory.line_graph(2)\n    l2.fundwallet(sats=2*10**6)\n\n    # Register a new Greenlight client.\n    c = clients.new()\n    c.register(configure=True)\n    gl1 = c.node()\n\n    # Start signer and connect to (l2)\n    s = c.signer().run_in_thread()\n    gl1.connect_peer(l2.info['id'], f'127.0.0.1:{l2.daemon.port}')\n\n    # Fund a channel (l2)----(gl).\n    # This results in the following network\n    # (l1)----(l2)----(gl)\n    l2.rpc.fundchannel(c.node_id.hex(), 'all')\n    # Generate a block to synchronize and proceed\n    # with the channel funding.\n    bitcoind.generate_block(1, wait_for_mempool=1)\n    # Wait for the channel to confirm.\n    wait_for(lambda:\n        gl1.list_peers().peers[0].channels[0].state == 'CHANNELD_NORMAL'\n    )\n\n    # Wait for all channels to appear in our view of the network.

We create an invoice on the Greenlight node and pay it with the <code>l1</code> node routed via the <code>l2</code> node.

You have written your first test using the  <code>gl-testing</code> testing framework and a Greenlight node. Our test creates a small line graph network consisting of 3 lightning nodes with a  Greenlight node at the end.

Therefore we first need to set a number of environment  variables on our host, that the <code>gl-client</code> library will pick up and  use. Just copy the following lines from your docker-shell:</p> <pre><code>export GL_CA_CRT=/tmp/gltesting/**tmpdir**/certs/ca.pem\nexport GL_NOBODY_CRT=/tmp/gltesting/**tmpdir**/certs/users/nobody.crt\nexport GL_NOBODY_KEY=/tmp/gltesting/**tmpdir**/certs/users/nobody-key.pem\nexport GL_SCHEDULER_GRPC_URI=https://localhost:**scheduler_port**\n</code></pre> <p>The first three lines tell the client library which identity to load itself, and how to verify the identity of the scheduler when connecting. These must match the lines printed above. The last line tells the client to connect to our mock scheduler instead of the production scheduler, the port must match the one printed above.</p> <p>Why is this random?</p> <p>We usually run tests in parallel, which requires that we isolate the tests from each other. If we did not randomize the ports and directories, we could end up with tests that interfere with each other, making debugging much harder, and resulting in flaky tests.</p> <p>We now can create a client on our host that we can mess around with.</p> <p>Lets have a look at the following example application that we will explain in more detail in another tutorial.
